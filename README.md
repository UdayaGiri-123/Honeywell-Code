# Honeywell-Code
Dear Sir/Mam,
This code only include back-end part using Node js of the Movie ticket booking app.
I couldn't implement Front-end part as I have not used the react on my local PC so far.I used to practice n create projects on online editors like sandbox.
I used MongoDB to store database of Username & passwords. Please ensure mongod is running in the pc to check the functionality of this code.
The database of {username,passwords} will be shown in UserDB in Mongo 
db.User.find({})

Kindly consider this.
